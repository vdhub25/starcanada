            <p>Piano moving deserves a category all its own, not just because pianos are at once enormously heavy, unwieldy and delicate, but also because they can hold sentimental value capable of producing everything from a Chopin nocturne to a Joplin
                rag. Moving your piano can be quite the task. Not just because of the delicate nature of the instrument, but because it’s something that’s extremely dear and valuable to you.</p>
            <p>If you are moving with a piano or antique piano, let us know so that so that we can prepare and bring the proper equipment and right number of crew/ team members for the job. Use the following table as a guide to determine the specific type
                of piano you have to move so you can tell us when you call.</p>

                <h3>Deciding to move is a great idea. However, you’ll need all the help you can get!</h3>
            </div>
            <p>As positive as a move to a new place is – that doesn’t make it to be something easy. In fact, relocation can be quite tough if you relax and let your guard down – you need to anticipate problems and meet them head-on. For example – how would
                you deal with relocating a piano? Don’t worry – Emergency Hub Moving has the perfect answer! Our piano movers Toronto are here to answer that very same question!</p>
            <div class="heading-border">
                <h3>Can you move your piano on your own?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Once you start dealing with your relocation, hitting a snag like relocating a piano can be tough – it can stop you in your tracks. But then the question arises – can you handle moving this precious instrument on your own, or do you need professional
                help to do it? Of course, it all depends on your level of skill and expertise. But in our experienced opinion, you should leave this to one of the best professional piano movers Brooklyn has to offer. Why? Because pianos are extremely
                difficult to move, and you’ll see why soon enough.</p>
            <h3>It’s a heavy instrument</h3>
            <p>Let’s face it – a piano is one of the heaviest musical instruments out there. It’s definitely not something you can pick up and load onto a van that easily, trust us. And yes, we know that this is something you’ve always known. But even so
                – people tend to underestimate the weight and overestimate their abilities. And with something as valuable as a piano, you don’t want to take any chances. That’s why Emergency Hub Moving is home to some of the most professional piano movers
                Brooklyn has. So if you want us to rid you of this burden – go right ahead and give us a call!</p>
            <div class="heading-border">
                <h3>A piano’s shape can be awkward</h3>
            </div>
            <p>And remember – the weight of the piano isn’t the only issue here, not by a longshot. In other news – pianos have very awkward shapes, ones that don’t lend themselves to easy moving. Among other things, that’s why they tend to be the constant
                setpieces in any room they occupy. Moving them through doorways and down stairs can really become a nightmare. That’s just one of the many reasons people opt to have professional movers relocate their piano – it’s really quite a hassle.</p>
            <div class="heading-border">
                <h3>They’re fragile, yet expensive</h3>
            </div>
            <p>But it’s not that most people who hire piano movers Toronto are lazy, or don’t care – quite the opposite. Not only is relocating a piano a giant hassle – any mistake can also be enormously costly. A piano is simply one of the most expensive
                musical instruments out there – and damaging one during transit can end up costing you a lot of money. That’s why we recommend you <a routerLink="/contact" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a>, and having people from Emergency Hub
                Moving just deal with this professionally.</p>
