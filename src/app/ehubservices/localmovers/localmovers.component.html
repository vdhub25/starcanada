                <h3>What to expect from your Toronto local move What happens the day before the move?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The day before your move, you’ll receive a text confirmation from dispatch. In the hours leading up to the move, our dispatch will send a group text linking you, the driver and the foreman, via which you can all communicate during the course
                of the move.</p>
            <div class="heading-border">
                <h3>What happens on the day of the move?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Dispatch will text you upon arrival of our Toronto local moving crew. We will continue to text throughout the moving process to make sure everything is going well and to smooth out any wrinkles. After the Emergency Hub crew has arrived and
                parked the truck, the foreman will come to your apartment/home to complete the paperwork. This paperwork is essentially comprised of clocking in and confirming your valuation choice.</p>
            <p>Next, our local movers will prep the building as necessary, checking for pre-existing damage to the building, the apartment and your belongings. After getting supplies from truck, we will pack, disassemble and wrap as required before loading
                the boxes, then furniture, onto the truck. Just before departing, we will check the apartment and building to ensure that everything has been removed and there is no damage.</p>
            <div class="heading-border">
                <h3>What happens once we arrive at the new location?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>At the new location, we will prep the building as necessary, while checking for pre-existing damage. After unloading furniture and boxes, our Toroto residential movers will unwrap furniture and re-assemble, position and unpack as required.
                Lastly, we will clean up and ask you to check the truck to ensure that everything has been unloaded before settling up.</p>
